Windows **post-exploitation tool** written by Benjamin Delpy\
A super-powerful **post-exploitation** tool used by penetration testers (and unfortunately attackers) to **extract Windows credentials** from memory.


It helps you grab things like:
- Plain-text passwords
- NTLM hashes
- Kerberos tickets (used for authentication)
- And other sensitive authentication info
