# What is WinRM

**WinRM** stads for **Windows Remote Management**\

It’s a **Microsoft protocol** that allows remote access to Windows machines — kind of like **SSH** but for Windows.

WinRM lets me:
- Run commands on a remote Windows system 
- Manage services, processes, and files
- Use PowerShell Remoting

### Port Numbers
HTTP : **5985**\
HTTPS : **5986**
