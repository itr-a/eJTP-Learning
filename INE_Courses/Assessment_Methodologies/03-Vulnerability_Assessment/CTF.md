# Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1

### Objective: Identify the services running on the machine, perform a detailed vulnerability scan, and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

**Flag 1**: Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.

```bash
root@INE:~# nmap -sC -sV target.ine.local --script vuln --min-rate 1000

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
| http-enum: 
|   /test/: Test page
|   /robots.txt: Robots file
|   /phpinfo.php: Possible information file
|   /phpmyadmin/: phpMyAdmin

```

**Flag 2**: The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?

> "*data storage*" is the methods and locations where an applocation or system store sensitive informations.\
> Types of storage: **Databases**, **File ysytems**, **Session data**, **Local storage**, **Cloud storage**

```bash
# from the firs output,phpmyadmin is accessible from web server
|   /phpmyadmin/: phpMyAdmin

# Open directory on browser and explore the site
# Find mysql -> "secret info" 

FLAG2_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
**Flag 3**: A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?
```bash
# From the first output, phpinfo is accessible
|   /phpinfo.php: Possible information file

# Open directory on browser ans scroll down
FLAG3_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Flag 4**: Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.
```bash
# From the nmap vuln output, there's /password/ directory
root@INE:~# curl target.ine.local/password/
# text file 
root@INE:~# curl target.ine.local/flag.txt
```
